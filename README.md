This is an AI powered Cloud Monitoring System which detects anomalies in Azure resources. The system continuously fetches Azure metrics such as Network, Disk and CPU metrics which are analysed for anomalies.
If detected, alerts are sent via Emails.

This project has the potential to incorporate other services (like AWS, Oracle) and will be worked upon if and when we get access to appropriate credentials.

Key Features:
1. Real Time Monitoring
2. The model.ipynb file contains the SVM model made on the dataset of azure cloud logs.
3. Azure API is accessed to login the customer into the client.
4. Groq API is used for LLM used in the autogenerated emails for each anomaly.
5. The prototype.mp4 file is a demo of the model.
